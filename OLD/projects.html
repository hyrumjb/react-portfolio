                <p>here's a <a href="https://hyrumjb.github.io/silicon-slopes/">link</a> to check out this new one.
                    i like the interactivity and design of this site--to be fair, it really is quite simple--but it's sleek,
                    the sidebar nav works well, and it's functional and beautiful on all device sizes.

                    i like the design of this one--it's simple and minimalist but based on the crypto exchange okx.
                    the interaction is all javascript-based, and i feel like i'm starting to get more of a hold on
                    making it simple and clear.

                    once again, this is a project hat used just html and css (less javascript than even the last one), but
                    it seems way more well-designed than the last one. A lot of the features that I emulated in this come from
                    the sequoia capital website, especially the colorway and the fixed header, but there are some mixed ideas as well.

                    this is one that used html, css, and started using quite a bit of javascript to analyze the user's choices
                    and provide them with a grade. it uses openai as the engine behind the decision making, grading, and feedback.
                    the design is also built to be responsive to both mobile and varying sizes of desktop interfaces.

                </div>
                <p>this link should work right <a href="steve.html">here</a>. basically, it's a site about steve jobs, with some quotes, video tributes, and his biographer's thoughts on him.
                    also, if i do say so myself, it's some pretty good looking html.

                <p>this one was a project for cs111 at byu. i ended up spending quite a bit of time on it, and when it was 
                    running it was actually running quite beautifully. it lets you add a new block to a blockchain running on render
                    and to provide individualized data for each block. it actually runs quite well, saving the blockchain data, and the
                    ui is basic but aesthetic pa din.

                <p>this one was for cs260 at byu, which frankly was a class i wasn't ready for (and actually wasn't really supposed
                    to be in), but i learned a ton from it. i'm not necessarily proud of the aesthetic or even function of this one, but
                    i guess it worked by the end and at least i learned a ton out of necessity.
