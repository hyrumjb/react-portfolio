            <p>here's another little update, and it's clearly not perfect but i added some css. this should make the 
                page a big more visually appealing, plus i added some background art by a world-renowned artist who learned
                to use canva 5 minutes ago.
            </p>
            <p class="date">(5-1-2025)</p>
            <p>okay, i'm trying to build up this page from scratch, so here's what we're working with so far.
                i'll update this page as i continue to add skills to my toolkit, but this is me typing every line of code,
                so for now just html is what you're gonna get.

        <div>
            <h2>what's next?</h2>
            <p>go check out the pages above if you wanna see some real quality content. the <a href="about.html">about</a> page is pretty cool because
                it kind of just tells about my life. <a href="projects.html">projects</a> will show some stuff I've done, both on my own and a bit for school.
                and <a href="future.html">future</a> is probably the coolest because it's all the next and new ideas. check them out.
            </p>
